Failure Risk Assessment &amp; Reliability Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

🔍 Project Overview

The dashboard analyzes reliability signals across different categories, ages, statuses, and risk segments. It helps in:

Identifying high-risk zones

Quantifying severity levels

Assessing inactive/active system states

Analyzing age-dependent vulnerability patterns

Understanding decision outcomes (settled vs rejected vs pending events)

🧠 Analytical Highlights
1. Risk Distribution Modeling

Coverage Amount → Exposure profile

Claim Amount → Failure severity

Claim Status → Risk outcome classification

Active vs Inactive → System activity and reliability status

2. Vulnerability Analysis

Based on:

Age groups

Policy type / component type

Claim severity clusters

3. Reliability Segmentation

Visual breakdown of:

High-risk categories

Low-exposure stable groups

Mid-tier segments requiring monitoring

4. Decision Path Diagnostics

Tables show:

Rejections

Settlements

Pending cases
Simulating how engineering teams evaluate events in operational logs.
